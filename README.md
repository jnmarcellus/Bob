## Chatbot made with Python

This Python script is made for running only in Android devices. You can run this script using Python3 apk, that you can get from Playstore.

### 
How script works? 

It has 2 databases, one for questions and one for answers (ques.txt, ans.txt). 
To have a wonderful conversation you should add answers and questions to databases by yourself... 
Run the script and you will be asked for your name.
After that, you will be saluted... 

```markdown
print ("Hello " + uname)
```

**And than you can start the conversation only by talking to the phone, without typing anything.. :D  **
